        <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
        <p>I am a student in computer science, I really like doing things by myself and it leads me to start a lot of projects (often unfinished)<br />
            Currently working on enhancing my programming skills by doing any program that can improve my lifestyle<br />
            I also have a hobby of being a Vtuber on twitch, that helps me fight my fear of talking to people</p>
